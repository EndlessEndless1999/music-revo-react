# music-revo-react

My app is a website about the irish band My Bloody Valentine. It contains three of their releases, alone with a static background that changes when you click on an album. 

## Installation
- clone the repo
- cd into music_app
- npm i to install packages
- npm run dev to launch vite server and go to localhost:5173 to view the page

## Bugs
- Cards do not close when another is opened
- Like buttons are awkwardely placed and need positioning. Not sure how to implement this yet.
